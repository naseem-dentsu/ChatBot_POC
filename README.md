# ChatBot_POC
Node js version should be above 16

This is an express app that lets us connect to the Chatbot using langchain framework

Please use npm run start to start the server on PORT 3000
Please ask for env file with @naseem-dentsu or @aditi-kharche

There are two endpoints 
1. localhost:3000/api/query/search :  Uses search engines to create results for the Chatbot
2. localhost:3000/api/query/document : Uses webscraping to create results for the Chatbot

This is just the initial basic level chatbot further improvements to enhance the search skills 
require paid OpenApi access instead of a free one.
