Being an innovative cosmetic company, we blend cutting-edge technology with breakthrough science from Japan, so you can reveal your most vibrant and radiant self every day.\r\nA beauty story like no other.\r\nArinobu Fukuhara was only 23 and working as Chief Pharmacist in the Japanese Navy when he started to create a new way of thinking about health, inspired by Western science and innovations. His idea? To make a change not just on the surface but from deeper inside.\r\nWE BELIEVE THAT BEAUTY CAN BE FOUND\r\nEVERYWHERE, IN EVERYTHING AND IN EVERY PERSON.\r\n\r\nFor us, beauty is about so much more than what we see. It is a shared feeling; it is diverse and unifying. When we feel good, we can only do good.\r\nBy inspiring empathy,\r\n\r\nbeauty is the ultimate force for goodness.\r\n\r\nAnd true beauty is made with soul.\r\nTHE TRADITION\r\nWith one eye to the future and the other to the West, Shiseido is deeply rooted in tradition, and dedicated to celebrating the values and culture of Japan. Our products promote a unique sense of spiritual beauty, with a nod to emblematic care rituals.\r\nBody and soul are parts of a whole that we treat equally. This approach enables us to offer an authentic vision of beauty, derived from the very mechanisms of life.\r\nWe honour nature using ingredients taken from traditional pharmacopeia, which are grown and harvested with respect for their ecosystem..\r\nOur commitment to tradition and quest for innovation leads us to keep evolving over the years.\r\nTHE OMOTENASHI\r\nAt Shiseido, Omotenashi is at the heart of everything we do.

In this way, our holistic treatments bring you both beauty and profound wellbeing.\r\nMISS SHISEIDO\r\nWho is Miss Shiseido?\r\n\r\nShe isn’t just one person; the Miss Shiseidos are a group of experts who paved the way for the beauty ambassadors.\r\n\r\n1934 was the beginning of the Miss Shiseido beauty experts. Dressed in Western-style designer uniforms rather than traditional kimonos, they were trained in beauty techniques, cosmetic science, public speaking, fashion, and culture.\r\n\r\nThey traveled all over Japan with their knowledge to present the value of Shiseido products — showcasing the latest beauty rituals through skits called ‘Theatre of Modern Beauty’, and offering audience members personalised cosmetic consultations at the end of the show.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Omotenashi in our point of sales began with Miss Shiseido, as well as our commitment to launching and supporting women’s careers in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe “Miss Shiseido” programme now has more than 20,000 female beauty experts in 85 countries.\r\n\r\n#4\r\nHANATSUBAKI\r\nSHARING IS CARING\r\nOn top of developing beauty products, at Shiseido we have been providing our customers with skincare and makeup education for more than five decades.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Projects\\POC\\ChatBot_POC\\storage\\documents\\introduction.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":21,"to":41}}}}],["0180b914-57a8-47eb-8445-acafb27cfae8",{"pageContent":"The “Miss Shiseido” programme now has more than 20,000 female beauty experts in 85 countries.\r\n\r\n#4\r\nHANATSUBAKI\r\nSHARING IS CARING\r\nOn top of developing beauty products, at Shiseido we have been providing our customers with skincare and makeup education for more than five decades.\r\nBecause sharing beauty techniques is also a way to take care of our customers, the Camellia Club was created in 1937 to “spread the best beauty advice while enriching the tastes and culture of the modern woman”. Membership in the Club included a magazine subscription, as well as invitations to beauty events and conferences around Japan. It also included discount coupons for Shiseido products and gifts upon purchase. These gifts, adorned with the iconic camellia, were created by famous artists of the time.\r\nIn the same year, we also launched the Hanatsubaki magazine — an illustrated beauty glossy that you can still enjoy today. Throughout our history, our publications and advertising campaigns have aimed to empower our customers by promoting lifestyle trends and beauty artistry.\r\n\r\nJapanese philosophy. Meticulous quality. Advanced technology.\r\n\r\nThese three pillars create harmony in all our products and the singularity of our savoir-faire. At Shiseido, we bring together the objectivity of science with the subjectivity of creativity to innovate. We work to deepen our knowledge and understanding of the skin mechanisms, while offering the most enjoyable experience to our customers with beauty products that are both simple and complex in their design and formulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n#1\r\nOUR UNIQUE EXPERTISE\r\nSKINCARE","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Projects\\POC\\ChatBot_POC\\storage\\documents\\introduction.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":36,"to":52}}}}],["51e8d309-0691-4562-93e5-5a5a43d8f245",{"pageContent":"#1\r\nOUR UNIQUE EXPERTISE\r\nSKINCARE\r\nAt Shiseido, skincare is everything. Passionate about the beauty in life and the effect of inner body mechanisms on the skin surface, we offer unique expertise in dermatology. Our skincare products are powerful — they make the skin stronger and more resilient. They are safe, combine exclusive high-quality ingredients and technology, and work deeper to enhance your complexion from within.\r\nIn the tradition of Japanese beauty rituals, Shiseido skincare calls on the five senses with sensorial textures and fragrances based on aromachology, giving you a profound sense of wellbeing. From the cleanser you rinse off each night, to the serum you massage in each morning and night, each formula allows you to reveal your most vibrant and youthful radiance.\r\nTRUE BEAUTY STARTS WITH THE\r\nMIND AND SKIN IN HARMONY\r\n\r\nSUNSCREEN\r\nThe skin cannot fight UV rays alone. At Shiseido, we first introduced products with sun protection powers in Japan in 1923. Since then, we’ve continued to innovate with new sun protection technologies, giving skin the support it needs to defend itself. Recently, joining the HeatForceTM and WetForceTM patents, our SynchroShieldTM and Sun Dual CareTM technologies brought our R&D to new heights — working in tandem with the environment to naturally boost skin’s defence. We fuse this technology with skin-kind ingredients for weightless suncare that’s a joy to use. The result? Easy application, a cared-for complexion, and protection that works for you.\r\nWITH SHISEIDO,\r\nTHE SUN BECOMES A BEAUTY ALLY\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKE UP\r\nOur skincare enhances beauty from within.

Our goal is to find the best way to protect the skin in an optimal way against external factors, UV rays, and the passage of time, as well as the frantic rhythm of everyday life. Our research focuses on the study of three major systems fundamentally connected to our skin: the immune, nervous, and vascular systems.\r\n\r\nIMMUNITY\r\nSELF OR NON SELF?\r\n\r\nEXPLORING THE\r\nPHILOSPHY\r\n\r\nAT THE CORE OF A HUMAN WONDER.\r\nOur immune system protects us from a lot of things — pollution, infections, and stress — and our skin serves as the first line of defence with our internal sentinels, Langerhans cells and NK cells. These help to differentiate “self” (body cells) from “non-self” (antigens); if they detect a foreign substance, they will combat it immediately with the support of our nervous and vascular systems.\r\nMICROCIRCULATION","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Projects\\POC\\ChatBot_POC\\storage\\documents\\introduction.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":84,"to":108}}}}],["9cdce4ea-5812-4a1d-8da3-676d2153231a",{"pageContent":"MICROCIRCULATION\r\nEVERY PULSE TAKES US FURTHER DOWN AN INFINITELY BRANCHING,\r\nBEAUTIFUL CRIMSON RIVER.\r\n\r\nMicrocirculation provides the essential supply of water, oxygen, and nutrients necessary to the proper functioning of the skin; increasing its resilience and imbuing it with smoothness and radiance. Our cells live to the rhythm of our heartbeat.\r\nOur research enabled us to understand that the vascular network declines with age and under the influence of UV rays, but also that the quality of vessels has an impact on the elasticity of the skin\r\n\r\nNERVOUS SYSTEM\r\nTRACING THE\r\nBEAUTIFUL LINES\r\n\r\nTHAT RUN ALONG OUR BLOOD VESSELS TOWARDS THE BRAIN.\r\nOur sensory receptors receive signals to alert the brain of any damage to the skin that needs to be repaired. Through our research, we now know that interactions between the nervous system and skin cells are essential for the proper functioning of the skin and its regeneration, but also to increase collagen production. On top of that, we’ve been delving into neuroscience to integrate an emotional component to skincare, particularly through fragrance and aromachology, as well as sensorial textures.\r\nAll Shiseido products are inspired by the unique technologies born from our research in these three areas:\r\n\r\nLifeblood Research™\r\nOur 20-year research on the cardiovascular system led to the development of Lifeblood™, a science and technology that aims to support vital flow.\r\nImuGeneration Technology™\r\n25 years of studying the skin’s immune system has led to the development of our technology ImuGenerationTM, which uses Langerhans cells to preserve and stimulate the skin’s defensive action. Our findings allow stronger anti-ageing effects.\r\nReNeura Technology™\r\nShiseido created ReNeuraTM, a technology that increases communication between nerves and skin cells to stimulate the skin’s natural ability to regenerate and improve the efficacy of your products.

Some of these materials we’ve created entirely, and others we’ve improved for high performance.\r\n\r\nHYALURONIC ACID\r\nIn 1985, Shiseido was the first Japanese company to use biotechnology to produce hyaluronic acid for cosmetic use on a large scale. Ten years later, we reached another major achievement when creating a new hyaluronic acid, Super Bio-Hyaluronic Acid, which has an acetylated structure that captures twice as much water and optimises its affinity with the skin.\r\nIn 2022, for the first time, Shiseido combined three different hyaluronic acids in the Essential Energy range for better absorption and water retention to guarantee longer-lasting hydration.\r\nRETINOL\r\nShiseido research has made it possible to maximise the action of another significant active ingredient, pure retinol. After 30 years of work, we managed to stabilise it, using meticulously calibrated manufacturing processes and with the development of totally hermetic packaging that guarantees maximum efficacy, as in the Vital Perfection range.\r\nThis is an achievement that has been recognised by the Japanese Ministry of Health.\r\nThe power of aromachology","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Projects\\POC\\ChatBot_POC\\storage\\documents\\introduction.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":127,"to":140}}}}],["b6cb6da2-8ee4-4a2c-9edd-12c5576d81ea",{"pageContent":"This is an achievement that has been recognised by the Japanese Ministry of Health.\r\nThe power of aromachology\r\nIn the 1990s, Shiseido began to study the power of scents on psychological and physiological wellbeing, as well as their impact on skin conditions. We discovered unsuspected benefits, such as improving the quality of sleep, reducing sebum production, relieving stress, and maintaining optimal hormonal balance. The fragrance in our #1 Ultimune serum contains the ImuCalm CompoundTM, an accord based on rose and lotus that has scientifically proven anti-stress and soothing actions.\r\n\r\n#5\r\nTHE FUTURE OF RESEARCH\r\nThe Yokohama-based Global Innovation Centre (GIC), which opened in 2019 in Japan, symbolises Shiseido’s commitment to excellence and investment in research and development.\r\n\r\nConceived as an open urban laboratory, the GIC is dedicated to cutting-edge innovation and the promotion of global communication and collaboration between consumers, researchers, business partners, and experts around the world.\r\n\r\nIn a space dedicated to employee wellbeing and furnished with state-of-the-art equipment, in-house researchers work on flexible and innovative projects that free their creativity and imagination.\r\n\r\nThe GIC also houses two floors of open communication spaces where consumers can immerse themselves in the world of Shiseido and be inspired by beauty; with a Beauty Bar where they can try out Shiseido innovations firsthand and interact with the researchers who created them.

The Enmei herb, known for its exceptional anti-aging properties and used in the Future Solution LX products, comes from 350-year-old trees that grow on Mount Koya. The Waso range contains yuzu and rice and is also a good example of how we promote the excellence of local production and support farmers from different regions of Japan. Our ingredients are ethically sourced to minimise environmental impact and maximise quality and credibility.\r\nA VIRTUOUS CIRCLE\r\n\r\nFOR PEOPLE, NATURE, AND THE SKIN\r\n\r\n#2\r\nRESPECTING OUR GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT\r\nBEING AWARE\r\nWhere and how we live impacts our skin's quality.
